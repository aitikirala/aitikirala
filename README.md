## About Me

I'm a Computer Science student at the University of Maryland, College Park, passionate about developing secure software solutions. I have experience in full-stack development, machine learning, and have worked on a variety of projects ranging from AI-driven applications to web services.

When I'm not coding, you can find me tutoring, focusing on self-care, or exploring new tech trends.
